  Mail Gem for Ruby lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/sendmail.rb Email From:
  Address Arbitrary Shell Command Injection 

description: > 
  Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to the failure to properly
  sanitise input passed from an email from address in the 'deliver()'
  function in 'lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/sendmail.rb' before
  being used as a command line argument. This may allow a remote
  attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
