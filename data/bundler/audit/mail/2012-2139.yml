title: Mail Gem for Ruby File Delivery Method to Parameter Traversal Arbitrary File Manipulation 

description: > 
  Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a remote
  attacker to traverse outside of a restricted path. The issue is due
  to the program not properly sanitizing user input, specifically
  directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied via the
  'to' parameter within the delivery method. This directory traversal
  attack would allow the attacker to modify arbitrary files.
