title: Ruby on Rails JSON Gem Arbitrary Symbol Creation Remote DoS

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow a remote denial of service.
  The issue is due to the JSON gem being tricked in to generating Ruby symbols
  during the parsing of certain JSON documents. Since Ruby symbols are not
  garbage collected, a remote attacker can crash a users system. This also may
  allow the attacker to create arbitrary objects that may be used to bypass
  certain security mechanisms and potentially allow SQL injection attacks to
  be conducted.
