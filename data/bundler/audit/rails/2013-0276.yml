title: Ruby on Rails Active Record attr_protected Method Bypass 

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the attr_protected method of the
  Active Record. The issue is triggered during the handling of a specially
  crafted request, which may allow a remote attacker to bypass protection
  mechanisms and alter values that would otherwise be protected.
