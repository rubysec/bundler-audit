title: Ruby on Rails HTML Escaping Code XSS 

description: > 
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the HTML
  escaping code functionality does not properly escape a single quote
  character. This may allow a user to create a specially crafted
  request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
  within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
