title: Ruby on Rails SafeBuffer Object [] Direct Manipulation XSS 

description: >
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because athe application
  does not validate direct manipulations of SafeBuffer objects via
  '[]' and other methods. This may allow a user to create a specially
  crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's
  browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the
  server.
