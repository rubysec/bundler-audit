  Ruby on Rails params_parser.rb Action Pack Type Casting Parameter Parsing
  Remote Code Execution 

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in params_parser.rb of the Action Pack.
  The issue is triggered when a type casting error occurs during the parsing
  of parameters. This may allow a remote attacker to potentially execute
  arbitrary code.
