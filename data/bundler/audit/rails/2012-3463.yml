title: Ruby on Rails select_tag Helper Method prompt Value XSS 

description: >
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because input passed via the
  prompt value is not properly sanitized by the select_tag helper method
  before returning it to the user. This may allow a user to create a
  specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in
  a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser
  and the server.
